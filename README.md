# ispmonitor

This is a work in progress project. The final version will be a fully hostable ISP monitoring tool.

TODO
- Add config edit in UX
- Add recording of ping times on frequent check
- Graph uptime/ping times
- Add periodic speed test and graph results
- Add filter / search to log viewer
- Improve UX for event viewing
- Update online status dynamically without page refresh
- Add SMS notifications of outages (how would this work when the internet is down?)
